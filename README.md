## Disclaimer ⚠️

I originally thought the challenge was only for 2 days. When I realized my mistake, I took the opportunity to spend a bit more time making the project better and more user-friendly. I hope you enjoy the experience! Your feedback is always welcome, so please, feel free to share it. 😊 Happy New Year!

- Drag and Drop: Effortlessly decorate your tree with various ornaments.
